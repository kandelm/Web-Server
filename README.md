### **README.md for Web Server Setup Task**

```markdown
# Web Server Setup (LAMP Stack)

## Overview
This project involves setting up a basic **LAMP stack** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) on a Linux machine. The task includes configuring the Apache server, creating a simple PHP-based website, integrating a MySQL database, and making the website accessible externally via a public URL. Additionally, version control is managed using **Git**, and the project is pushed to **GitHub**.

## LAMP Stack Setup

### Install Required Packages
To install Apache, MySQL, and PHP on your Linux machine, run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-server php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql -y
```

### Configure Apache
1. Create a test HTML file in the `/var/www/html/` directory:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello Apache!" > /var/www/html/index.html
   ```
2. Visit `http://<server-ip>/` in your browser to confirm that Apache is working correctly.

### Create a Simple Website
1. Replace the `index.html` file with a simple PHP file:
   ```bash
   echo "<?php echo 'Hello World!'; ?>" > /var/www/html/index.php
   ```
2. Visit `http://<server-ip>/` again to check that it shows "Hello World!".

### Configure MySQL
1. Secure the MySQL installation:
   ```bash
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```
   Follow the prompts to set the root password.
2. Create a new database and user:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE web_db;
   CREATE USER 'web_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'StrongPassword123';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON web_db.* TO 'web_user'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   EXIT;
   ```

### Modify the Website to Use the Database
1. Update the `index.php` file to connect to MySQL and display the visitor's IP address and the current time:
   ```php
   <?php
   $conn = new mysqli('localhost', 'web_user', 'StrongPassword123', 'web_db');
   if ($conn->connect_error) {
       die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
   }
   $time = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
   $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
   echo "Visitor IP: $ip <br> Current Time: $time";
   $conn->close();
   ?>
   ```
2. Visit `http://<server-ip>/` to check that the visitor's IP and current time are displayed.

### Testing Locally
Ensure that everything works by accessing the website at `http://<server-ip>/`.

### Make the Website Publicly Accessible
1. Configure firewall rules to allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic.
2. Obtain a public IP address or a domain name pointing to your server.
3. Update your DNS settings to point the domain to your server's public IP.
4. Test the external accessibility of your website.

## Git & GitHub

### Initialize Git Locally
Initialize a Git repository in the project directory:
```bash
cd /var/www/html
git init
```

### Create a `.gitignore` File
Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive files (e.g., database credentials):
```bash
echo "config.php" > .gitignore
```

### Commit Your Documentation & Source Code
1. Create a `README.md` file with instructions.
2. Add and commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial LAMP setup and documentation"
   ```

### Create and Push to a GitHub Repository
1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Add the GitHub repository as a remote and push:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/kandelm/Web-Server.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Networking Basics

### IP Address
An **IP address** is a unique identifier for a device on a network, used to route traffic between devices.

### MAC Address
A **MAC address** (Media Access Control address) is a unique hardware identifier for a network interface, used for local network communication.

### Switches, Routers, and Routing Protocols
- **Switches**: Devices that forward data within the same network.
- **Routers**: Devices that forward data between different networks.
- **Routing Protocols**: Protocols like OSPF and BGP used by routers to determine the best path for data.

### Remote Connection to Cloud Instance
To connect to a cloud-based Linux instance via SSH:
```bash
ssh username@<server-ip>
```

## Deliverables
1. **Documentation (Markdown File)**: A step-by-step guide on setting up the LAMP stack, using Git, and explaining networking concepts.
2. **GitHub Repository**: A repository containing your code, configuration files, and documentation.
3. **Public URL**: A link to your website, confirming it is publicly accessible.
